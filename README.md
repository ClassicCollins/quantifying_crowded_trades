`Introduction`: This thesis proposal seeks to address the challenges posed by crowded trades by means of quantification and comprehensive analysis. We will employ two measures to identify bubbles emerging in various sectors and assets and determine the optimal exit points before they deflate completely. These measures include "asset centrality" and "relative value." Asset centrality identifies crowded trading often linked to bubble formation, while the relative value measure aids in distinguishing crowding during a bubble's ascent from that during its descent. It is important to note that neither measure, in isolation, suffices to identify the full cycle of a bubble. However, when combined, they hold the potential to locate bubbles within sectors and assets.

`Problem Statement`: Diverse investment possibilities and risks are presented by the financial markets, necessitating efficient portfolio construction to optimize returns while mitigating risks. The effect of crowded trades, which are defined as an increase in the number of investors in particular assets or strategies and are frequently linked to speculative bubbles, poses a serious challenge to portfolio management. Early bubble detection is crucial for profiting from price spikes, but it's just as important to pull out of the market before the eventual correction to protect gains. The task at hand is to quantify and thoroughly analyze the formation and possible exit points of speculative bubbles and crowded trades in order to overcome the issues they present. The suggested research uses two metrics, "asset centrality" and "relative value," to evaluate and identify bubbles across a range of industries and variables in order to address this issue. Asset centrality facilitates the identification of crowded trading that may give rise to bubble development, whereas the relative value measure facilitates the differentiation of crowding during the climb from the decline of a bubble. It's crucial to remember that, when used separately, neither metric provides a complete understanding of the bubble cycle. Combining these metrics could help identify bubbles within industries and other aspects more accurately, which would help investors make better decisions about their investments. "Quantifying Crowded Trades: A Comprehensive Analysis," the topic of the thesis, is to look into and solve this issue.

`Goal`: In order to enable investors to generate excess returns, the goal of this thesis is to develop a comprehensive framework for quantifying crowded trades in different assets or investment strategies. It also uses measures like asset centrality and relative value to identify speculative bubbles.

`Objectives`: Develop a framework for quantifying the level of crowding in different assets or investment strategies.	
Utilize asset centrality and relative value to identify bubbles and discern whether they are inflating or deflating, with the goal of generating excess returns.
